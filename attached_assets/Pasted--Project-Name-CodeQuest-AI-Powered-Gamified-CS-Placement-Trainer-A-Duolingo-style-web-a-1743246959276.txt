## 🎯 *Core Features & Gamification Elements*  

### *1️⃣ Adaptive Learning Paths* 📚  
✅ Covers *OS, DBMS, CN, DSA, System Design, OOPs, Aptitude, Puzzles*.  
✅ *AI tracks weak areas* → Repeats difficult questions using *Spaced Repetition Algorithm*.  
✅ *Three Modes: **Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced* based on accuracy.  

### *2️⃣ AI-Powered Emotion Tracking* 🧠🎭 (Innovative Feature! 🚀)  
💡 Uses *Webcam Facial Recognition (OpenCV + DeepFace + MediaPipe)* to detect:  
- *Boredom (low focus, yawning, looking away)* → Pops up:  
  - A *random engaging mini-game or trivia* 🕹  
  - A *motivational quote* 💡  
  - A *fun short CS-related video* 🎥 (e.g., AI in gaming, tech innovations).  
- *Confusion (furrowed brows, hesitation)* → Auto-suggests:  
  - *Super-simple explanation* of the current topic.  
  - *Short 60-sec video tutorial* for quick clarification.  

### *3️⃣ Interactive Flashcards & MCQs* 🃏  
✅ Flashcards with *short explanations, multiple-choice, & fill-in-the-blank questions*.  
✅ *Spaced repetition* → Incorrect answers *reappear later* for reinforcement.  
✅ *Code Snippets & Debugging Challenges*.  

### *4️⃣ Gamified Challenges & Checkpoints* 🎮  
✅ *Mini-games at each level-up*:  
  - 💣 *Timer Bomb Challenge* → Answer within X seconds!  
  - 🔥 *Speed Code Sprint* → Solve coding puzzles before the clock runs out.  
  - 🤖 *Boss Battle* → AI-generated *mock interview* with live feedback.  
✅ Earn *XP, badges, streaks, and leaderboard ranks*!  

### *5️⃣ AI-Generated Personalized Learning Plan* 📊  
✅ AI *analyzes user performance* and recommends:  
  - “You need to revise Memory Management in OS.”  
  - “Try more graph-based DSA problems.”  
✅ Tracks *time spent, accuracy, & consistency*.  

### *6️⃣ Real-Time Placement Readiness Score* 🎯  
✅ Dashboard *tracks weak areas & strengths*.  
✅ *Mock interviews with GPT-4* → Scores clarity, efficiency, and correctness.

## 🛠 *Tech Stack (Beginner-Friendly & Scalable)*  

### *Frontend (Duolingo-Style UI 🎨)*  
✅ *React.js + Next.js* → Smooth, interactive UI.  
✅ *TailwindCSS + Framer Motion* → Engaging animations.  
✅ *Recharts.js* → Data visualization for progress tracking.  

### *Backend (Fast & Scalable ⚡)*  
✅ *Node.js + Express* → API server.  
✅ *MongoDB / PostgreSQL* → Stores user progress, scores, questions.  
✅ *Redis* → Stores streaks & leaderboard data.  

### *AI & Emotion Detection 🤖*  
✅ *OpenCV + DeepFace / MediaPipe* → Webcam-based *boredom & confusion detection*.  
✅ *GPT-4 API* → AI-generated *mock interviews & explanations*.  
✅ *TensorFlow.js* → AI-powered weak area detection.  

### *Deployment & Scaling*  
✅ *Vercel / Netlify* → Frontend hosting.  
✅ *AWS Lambda / Firebase Functions* → API handling.  
✅ *WebSockets (Socket.io)* → Live leaderboard & real-time feedback.
