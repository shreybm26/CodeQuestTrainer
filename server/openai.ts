    'Data Structures': 'Data structures are organized ways to store and organize data for efficient use. Think of them like different types of containers - arrays are like rows of boxes, linked lists are chains where each link points to the next, and trees branch out like family trees with parent-child relationships.',
    
    'Trees and Graph Traversal': 'Tree traversal is like exploring a family tree - you can visit relatives in different orders. In Computer Science, you can go depth-first (explore one branch fully before moving to siblings) or breadth-first (visit all siblings before moving to children). Graph traversal is similar but handles more complex connections.',
    
    'Algorithms': 'Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or recipes for solving problems. Just like you follow a recipe to bake a cake, computers follow algorithms to sort data, find information, or make decisions. The efficiency of these steps determines how quickly the computer can solve the problem.',
    
    'Big O Notation': 'Big O Notation is a way to describe how long an algorithm takes to run as the input grows. Think of it like estimating delivery time - O(n) means delivery time grows directly with distance, while O(nÂ²) means it grows much faster, like delivering to n addresses in n different cities.',
    
    'Recursion': 'Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve smaller versions of the same problem. It\'s like looking up a word in a dictionary, finding another unfamiliar word in the definition, and looking that up too, continuing until you understand all the words.',
    
    'Memory Management': 'Memory management is how computers keep track of and allocate memory. It\'s like managing desk space - you need to know what information you\'re using (in RAM), what you might need soon (cached), and what can be stored away (in storage).',
    
    'Process Scheduling': 'Process scheduling is how a computer\'s operating system decides which tasks to run when. It\'s like a chef deciding which dishes to cook in what order - some are urgent, some can wait, and sometimes you need to switch between tasks to keep everything moving forward efficiently.',
    
    'Database Management': 'Database management is organizing, storing, and retrieving data efficiently. Think of it as a highly organized library system - information is categorized, indexed, and structured so you can quickly find exactly what you need, even among millions of entries.',
    
    'Graph Algorithms': 'Graph algorithms help solve problems on networks of connected points. They\'re like finding the fastest route on a map - whether you\'re calculating the shortest path between cities, determining the most important person in a social network, or optimizing delivery routes.',

The time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of nodes, as we visit each node once. The code would recursively calculate height, returning -1 for imbalanced subtrees and propagating this value upward.'
